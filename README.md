Hey there 👋,

I am Full-Stack Web Developer.  I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible.  You can read my development related blogs on [medium](https://medium.com/@spratham72/clone-of-smallcase-c68f0fc5c19a).  If you found value in something I have created, please feel free contact :-

### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.  I 💕 a good onboarding readme with good example.

### My Digital Garden 🌱

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on my personal website [waylonwalker.com](https://waylonwalker.com) and [dev.to/waylonwalker](https://dev.to/waylonwalker).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **data** using **python** and **javascript**.
